    Removed the ability to create thick volumes in a ScaleIO Storage Pool
    that has zero-padding disabled; creation of thin volumes from these
    pools is allowed. A new configuration option has been added to
    override this new behavior and allow thick volumes, but should not
    be enabled if multiple tenants will utilize thick volumes from a shared
    Storage Pool.
